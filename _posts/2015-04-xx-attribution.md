One of the most popular and enduring forms of mystery fiction is the [_whodunit_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whodunit). Readers and audiences love following along and trying to determine the actual identity of the attacker based on the clues and observations provided. During and after incident investigations, many folks from the actual investigators on the case up to the public (armchair DFIR!) tries to figure out the same thing. Unlike "whodunit" fiction, though, we may not have all the information needed or indeed ever get confirmation of the right answer.

## What attribution means in DFIR

"Attribution" in the DFIR world means assigning some identity to the adversary in an incident. That identity may not necessarily drill all the way down to the "real life" name and address (though in some cases it will). But it can also include correlating a set of intrusions to the same entity, possibly providing some set of data like region or affiliation or operational aspects and observations.
