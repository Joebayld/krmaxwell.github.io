One of the most popular and enduring forms of mystery fiction is the [_whodunit_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whodunit). Readers and audiences love following along and trying to determine the actual identity of the attacker based on the clues and observations provided. During and after incident investigations, many folks from the actual investigators on the case up to the public (armchair DFIR!) tries to figure out the same thing. Unlike "whodunit" fiction, though, we may not have all the information needed or indeed ever get confirmation of the right answer.

## What attribution means in DFIR

"Attribution" in the DFIR world means assigning some identity to the adversary in an incident. That identity may not necessarily drill all the way down to the "real life" name and address (though in some cases it will). But it can also include correlating a set of intrusions to the same entity, possibly providing some set of data like region or affiliation or operational aspects and observations.

## When and how it matters

The importance of attribution varies across the _type_ of attribution under discussion as well as the _consumer_ of that intelligence. Law enforcement, intelligence community, and military organizations, for example, have an interest in the actual meatspace identity because they may have authority to apprehend or carry out some type of retribution. (Criminal actors have a similar interest from their perspective, whether for OPSEC validation or for their own illegal retribution.) For security and malware analysts, however, attribution in that sense rarely matters too much. The exception to that is when the adversary is located in a jurisdiction where civil or criminal complaints can be brought.

However, analysts **do** care about understanding the TTPs and capabilities of a given adversary as well as strategic information (e.g. motives and targeting).
