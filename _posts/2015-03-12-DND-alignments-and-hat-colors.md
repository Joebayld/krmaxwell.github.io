So [@da_667](https://twitter.com/da_667) started a thread [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/da_667/status/576127675355541504) today with a "hypothetical" scenario:

> Let's have a discussion. But before we do that - Disclaimer: Parentel discretion is advised. Any resemblance of the following scenario to any actual real-life scenario is purely coincidental. Scenario: You manage IDS/IPS systems, honeypots, FPC devices, whatever. You caught some bad shit coming over your pipes: attackers trying to exploit some of your webservers. Some of these exploits are just php system() calls to curl to download files over FTP. These FTP calls contained creds. Would you then, proceed to go on a download spree on the payload server with said creds? Addendum: fuck ethics. This is a scenario where you only get a single shot. Would you or would you not use the creds and download everything?

In the ensuing discussion, [@stauken](https://twitter.com/stauken) made a [D&D alignment reference](https://twitter.com/stauken/status/576132190813057024):
> so what you're saying is, lawful evil exists for a reason

As often happens among geeks, this led to a wild and fast-moving discussion about D&D alignments. One of my favorite sites for this sort of discussion is [EasyDamus](http://www.easydamus.com/alignment.html). For those of you not familiar with this system, imagine your "ethical" alignment along two axes: **Good vs Evil** and **Law vs Chaos**. For "law", you can mentally substitute "order", since it has more to do with with honor and adherence to rules than what we think of as "law" in our society.

Conversely, in hacking tradition, we often refer to the color of "hats" along a simpler one-dimensional axis, "white" to "grey" to "black". "White hat hackers" are envisioned as Lawful Good [LG], "black hat hackers" as some form of evil (usually Neutral Evil [NE]), and "grey hats" as something else like "chaotic good" [CG].
