In the process of 'leveling up' as a programmer, I have started trying to implement some basic software engineering concepts. This post serves as a way for me to organize my own thoughts as I learn.

## Basic flow
I've used the [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) for quite a while for lots of things (recently including [this blog](https://github.com/krmaxwell/krmaxwell.github.io)). But this mostly applies to processes that use continuous deployment, like Github itself. It can also work pretty well for documentation and other similar projects that don't need the concept of "releases".

For projects with staged releases, we need a few more bits. The git branching model [documented](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) by [Vincent Driessen](https://twitter.com/nvie) has become quite popular lately. I think it really just shows how to use git for implementing a very common model we've used for a long time. (I recall using this basic approach twenty years ago when our source code collaboration just relied on using a whiteboard to document who had which file checked out. That sucked as hard as it sounds.)

This model uses two primary branches: `master`, which must always be deployable and represents the current release, and `development`, which contains the currently-accepted features and bug fixes for the next release. Hot fixes for production-affecting bugs can be merged directly into both of these, but otherwise everything goes through `development` before going to `master`.

## Community implementations

When implementing this flow in community-development projects (such as open source software), we have to take a few steps. Github will show a link to a [contributor guide](https://github.com/blog/1184-contributing-guidelines) on all issue and pull request pages. The guidelines document should explain this flow, as well as any other considerations (such as licensing and coding standards). Contributors should generally issue pull requests against the `development` branch, for example.

## Pre-commit

The smart folks over at [Yelp](http://www.yelp.com) have a fun tool called [pre-commit](http://pre-commit.com). This tool uses [git hooks](http://githooks.com) to run a few scripts before committing code, even locally. This primarily should include code linters, although in some organizations some level of testing may also run here.

For an example, take a look at the [pre-commit configuration file for Maltrieve](https://github.com/krmaxwell/maltrieve/blob/3f6fdcc3c8d139dbab3c5153efc95f65b8f30251/.pre-commit-config.yaml). This runs a few scripts to format my code according to [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/), check any JSON and YAML files, etc. While slavish adherence to PEP8 can create problems, in general it will result in more readable and standard code. Other languages have similar tools and linters available, so you should be able to use pre-commit even if you code in some other language like C.

Tools like [Landscape](https://landscape.io) can also run these sorts of linters and style checkers (among other things) to generate code quality metrics. For open-source projects, this can work well in conjunction with pre-commit because it can look at code in PRs from outside contributors.

## Testing

I remember trying test-driven development a decade ago, and for whatever reason the lesson didn't take. (Probably because I wrote all my code in Perl at the time.) However, I've committed to improving code quality by writing tests, if not going to full [TDD](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?TestDrivenDevelopment) just yet. Rather than use the standard _unittest_ in Python, [_py.test_](http://pytest.org) allows a developer to get started much more quickly. Effectively, I just create an additional Python module with a set of functions that start with _test_ (e.g. "_test_data_load()_") and assert that results from functions in my production code meet certain expectations. It uses simple decorators for setup and teardown. While larger projects might need more complex testing environments, everything I currently write fits easily into this tool.

## Continuous Integration

Now that I have tests, I can start carrying out continuous integration. This means I have automated testing running that gives me a result before I merge it back to `master` (or even `development`). GitHub handles all of my projects and has great support for CI tools. At the moment, Travis CI and CircleCI have my attention. In both cases, developers can log into the tools with their GitHub accounts and specify which repositories to check. CircleCI has some basic support for getting started automatically, but taking proper advantage of either tool will require a small, straightforward configuration file written in YAML.

After testing both extensively, I chose to stick with CircleCI. Both offer free testing for open-source projects (by which they seem to mean "public repositories"), but CircleCI has a little lower pricing than Travis CI for private repositories or closed-source projects. I also liked how the UI integrates a little more with GitHub, making it easy to check on a pull request, branch, or commit right from its interface. Both provide solid options, though, and for many people Travis CI may actually be the right choice.

## Test Coverage

Getting those green check marks when all tests pass gives a great feeling. But if the tests only handle a small amount of code, then the probability increases that things have broken and nobody knows it. [Code coverage](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/TestCoverage.html) tools measure how much code actually gets exercised by tests. (Note the distinction between that and how much code gets tested **well**.) For _py.test_, I use a plugin called, obscurely enough, [_pytest-cov_](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pytest-cov). This outputs a little table after the tests run:

```
-------------------- coverage: platform linux2, python 2.6.4-final-0 ---------------------
Name                 Stmts   Miss  Cover
----------------------------------------
myproj/__init__          2      0   100%
myproj/myproj          257     13    94%
myproj/feature4286      94      7    92%
----------------------------------------
TOTAL                  353     20    94%
```

Percentages on my projects have not climbed to where I would like them, but they've increased from 0%.

For seeing automated results, [Coveralls](https://coveralls.io) integrates well with both of the CI tools listed above. In CircleCI, just add some environment variables so that API keys don't have to go into a public repository. (In this area, Travis CI probably integrates a little better with Coveralls.)
