title: "On learning new programming languages"
categories: Programming,Education

I decided a couple of decades ago that I wanted to speak Spanish beyond the very basics we learned in junior high and high school (which didn't include much, even in Texas). That meant I wanted to achieve a conversational level, at a minimum. Circumstances at the time prevented me from moving to another country for _full_ immersion, but I could come close to that living in Dallas. Through intense self-directed study and spending large amounts of time in environments where I *had to* speak Spanish - or at least *could* speak Spanish - eventually I reached good professional proficiency.

This demonstrates a good model for learning programming languages.

## Do the work

**There is no shortcut to success in learning. You have to do the work.** People love to talk about how much they "want" to learn something, or how they started and got distracted. Somehow they often give the impression that that's almost as good.

It's not.

Learning a new skill requires time and effort. While [Learn X in Y minutes](http://learnxinyminutes.com/) is a wonderful reference and high-level overview, it can't burn knowledge into your synaptic pathways to the degree needed for proficiency. Prepare yourself for mental exercise.

Note, I certainly understand that other people may learn in different ways. The whole issue of learning theory and pedagogy lies well outside my expertise. So the rest of this post will just discuss what has worked for me. Hopefully somebody else can get some good ideas they can use out of it.

## Build your knowledge

Instruction for people who already understand code is good (think http://learncodethehardway.org/ not http://www.codecademy.com/learn).

I'm liking [A re-introduction to Javascript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/A_re-introduction_to_JavaScript) and [Go by Example](https://gobyexample.com/) for this reason.

Syntax and grammar

## Exercise your knowledge

**Learn through projects and drills, not just reading. Work on this every day, or as close to it as feasible.**
