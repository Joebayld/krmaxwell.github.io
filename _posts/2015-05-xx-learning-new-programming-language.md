title: "On learning new programming languages"
categories: Programming,Education

I decided a couple of decades ago that I wanted to speak Spanish beyond the very basics we learned in junior high and high school (which didn't include much, even in Texas). That meant I wanted to achieve a conversational level, at a minimum. Circumstances at the time prevented me from moving to another country for _full_ immersion, but I could come close to that living in Dallas. Through intense self-directed study and spending large amounts of time in environments where I *had to* speak Spanish - or at least *could* speak Spanish - eventually I reached good professional proficiency.

This demonstrates a good model for how I learn programming languages. Note, I certainly understand that other people may learn in different ways. The whole issue of learning theory and pedagogy lies well outside my expertise. So I just want to talk about what has worked for me, and hopefully somebody else can get some good ideas they can use out of it.

## Do the Work

There is no shortcut to success in learning. You have to do the work.

## Projects
Also, learn through projects and drills, not just reading.

> I'm a fan of project-oriented learning. Design a taks, Google your way out of it until it works.

## Build on what you know
Instruction for people who already understand code is good (think http://learncodethehardway.org/ not http://www.codecademy.com/learn).

I'm liking [A re-introduction to Javascript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/A_re-introduction_to_JavaScript) and [Go by Example](https://gobyexample.com/) for this reason.
