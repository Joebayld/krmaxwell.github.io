Combining two of my oldest hobbies (gaming and coding), [Hackertainment.net](http://hackertainment.net) tries to list as many coding and security "games" as possible. This also includes programming challenges and contests, like [Project Euler](http://projecteuler.net).

[Pull requests or issues](https://github.com/technoskald/coding-entertainment) are welcome, so if you know of similar ones, please let me know.
