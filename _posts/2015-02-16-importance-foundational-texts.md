Every field of study has a set of foundational texts. They may not reflect the state of the art, but one generally needs at least a passing familiarity with them to claim any significant expertise.

For example, imagine a political scientist who'd never read Machiavelli's _The Prince_ or perhaps de Tocqueville's _Democracy in America_. Medical students have almost all studied at least one edition of _Gray's Anatomy_. Computer scientists regard _The Art of Computer Programming_ as one of the cornerstones of the entire field.

What about digital forensics & incident response, or threat intelligence? I'd suggest two volumes that everyone working in this area should read.

- [_The Cuckoo's Egg_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cuckoo%27s_Egg) tells the story of an actual computer investigation that began in 1986. The lessons regarding attribution, honeypots, and espionage have a lot more relevance than some might realize.
- [_Psychology of Intelligence Analysis_](https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/books-and-monographs/psychology-of-intelligence-analysis/) explains important aspects of critical thinking and cognitive biases essential to this field.

I don't mean to imply at all that these two books alone will provide all the expertise a practitioner needs. Certainly specializations within the field will have additions. But any serious student of DFIR or threat intelligence should read these two and understand the lessons within.

If you have additional suggestions, I'd love to talk with you on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/kylemaxwell) about it.
