Today, [Kevin Thompson](https://twitter.com/bfist) and I [presented](https://speakerdeck.com/technoskald/incident-patterns) at the [SANS DFIR Summit](www.sans.org/event/dfir-summit-2014) on patterns of incident types found within the [VERIS Community Database](http://vcdb.org). Our research focused first on identifying interesting patterns within the data set, then examining those patterns more closely for TTPs and other potentially useful insights.

We've made all our code [available](http://threatic.us) in the form of IPython notebooks for purposes of reproducibility and collaboration. The project hasn't concluded, either; today's talk really just gave a glimpse of our work. We have plans to investigate more TTPs and provide additional data analytics in the future.
