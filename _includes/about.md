Typical nerd: neckbeard, math and CS degree, plays too many computer games and D&amp;D. Unix Ã¼ber alles, GPL zealot, re-activated activist. Currently a researcher at iDefense (Verisign), based in Dallas. Don't ask me about Windows anything. Original developer of [Combine](https://github.com/mlsecproject/combine) and [Maltrieve](http://maltrieve.org). I previously worked on the [VZ DBIR](http://www.verizonenterprise.com/DBIR/) and what is now the VZ "Cyber Intelligence Center" but got out of there because Big Red is evil. I also built the incident response function at Heartland Payment Systems (post-breach _thankyouverymuch_). I speak fluent Spanish but sadly not Portuguese of any flavor.
