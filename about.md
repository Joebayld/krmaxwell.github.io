Stereotypical nerd: neckbeard, math and CS degree, plays too many computer games. Currently working as a developer and product manager for a cyber threat intelligence provider.

Original developer of [Combine](https://github.com/mlsecproject/combine) and [Maltrieve](http://maltrieve.org). I previously worked on the [VZ DBIR](http://www.verizonenterprise.com/DBIR/) and built the incident response function at Heartland Payment Systems post-breach. My professional programming career started over twenty years ago and my infosec career almost that long ago.
